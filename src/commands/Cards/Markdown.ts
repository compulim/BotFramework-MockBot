A paragraph is the \r\nbasic block of Markdown. \r\nA paragraph is what text will turn \r\ninto when there is no reason it should become anything else.\r\n\r\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* \nand **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\r\n\r\n## Lists\r\n\r\n### Ordered list\r\n\r\n1. one\r\n2. two\r\n3. three\r\n4. four\r\n\r\n### Unordered list\r\n\r\n* An item\r\n* Another item\r\n* Yet another item\r\n* And there\'s more...\r\n\r\n## Paragraph modifiers\r\n\r\n### Code block\r\n\r\n\`\`\`\r\nCode blocks are very useful for developers and other \r\npeople who look at code or other things that are written \r\nin plain text.

The easiest way to do these is to\n select what you want to make a link and hit \`Ctrl+L\`.\r\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\r\n* Some links have [query strings](https://bing.com?q=some value) \nthat need encoding\r\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\r\n\r\n## Horizontal rule\r\n\r\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt\'s sometimes handy for breaking things up.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Table\r\n|header1|header 2|\n|----|----|\n| cell 1 | cell 2|\n| cell three | cell four|\r\n\r\n## Whitespace\r\n\r\nHere\'s a line.\r\n\r\nThis has the standard two newlines before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has four newlines before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has six newlines before it.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>This has two newlines and four &lt;br/&gt; tags before it."
